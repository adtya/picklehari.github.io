<hr/><p>Over the past 20 years of my existence, I have tended to realize over and over that there tends to be another undiscovered social universe beyond what we live in, and the key to visit and unlock these mystery universes is to interact with other beings, human or nonhuman. The popular science communicator Bill Nye said: “Every person you meet, knows something you don’t”. I believe this philosophy can be applied to far beyond human beings. For instance, our pet dogs are often way more good at making people feel good than ourselves. I believe everyone has something to teach us and everyone is worth admiration at some level. I admire Elon Musk for his determination, Genghis Khan for his strategies and even Adolf Hitler for his excellent oratory skills.
We tend to believe, that the people we admire, often have everything figured out. At this point, I come to realize that everyone feels like a mess sometimes, and everyone has people they tend to look up to. In fact, there do exist people who admire you or something in you, even though you feel like yesterday’s ramen.</p>

<p>We tend to live in a world that tends to live in fear, an era wherein peace is maintained by nuclear weapons rather than people’s sense of understanding. Even more heartbreaking is the fact that everyone tends to be scared of the other, afraid of being vulnerable to one another and it is this fear that often inhibits us from discovering the above-mentioned universes. I tend to remain skeptical of the population estimate of 7B, this number disregards a very huge population of other fellow beings that share this planet with us. I believe the future wherein we disregard our differences and picture ourselves as part of a worldwide tribe, is the only future that looks good.</p>
