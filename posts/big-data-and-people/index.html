<hr/><p>Living in a data prosperous society, I wonder if the data revolution is the 21st-century renaissance. Big data could be considered analogous to the printing press of the early 15th century.
Organisations such as Datakind, has made crash models for streets in New York and New Orleans helping governments redesign roads and prevent accidents. Open maps have made University students in Tandale (A district in Tanzania) to mark key local resources and services and thus in turn help organizations serve the citizens better. These examples remains an acorn in an oak tree. A slight reminder that we too can bring in a change.</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelming potential big data has on solving issues we face, this superpower hasn’t been utilized to it’s fullest. Open data published by WHO states that 1.4 B people in the world died from HIV/AIDS in 2017 and for most regions, the number is directly correlated to the lack of supply in contraceptives. Women in Rajasthan, are still forced to walk miles for obtaining resources such as water and these women are forced to smoke about 400 cigarettes worth smoke in the name of fuel. As developers or advocates of technology, we can either hack for money or hack for a purpose and the latter I believe is a reason worth living.</p>
