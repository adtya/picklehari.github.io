<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">Why I believe Cutting edge isn&#39;t always revolutionising</div><div class="section" id="content">Wed Apr 11, 2018 &#183; 325 words

<hr/><p>Being born in a time when Internet and computer technology was miracles in the eyes of the common folk and at a very rural area ,I have seen how this &ldquo;magic&rdquo; have rapidly changed lives and perceptions of even the poorer sections of society. Growing up admist all the middle class family drama I was exposed to the wonders of Internet and computers from my very childhood that I almost took it for granted.From Floppy Drives to Cloud storage,from BSNL dialup connections to the high speed mobile networks,from Dangerous Dave to GTA 5,from Nokia 1110 to the latest iPhone X,from Windows 95 to Windows 10,from XBOX 300 to XBOX ONE,from Antenna based B/W Television sets to Netflix on UHD sets ,I have seen how the world grew around me without even realising it.
Recently I ran across an amazing ted talk by <a href="https://www.triciawang.com/">Tricia Wang</a> ,which summarised to how much we need to invest on socialware.She states how her time and experience in Nokia proved the fact that <a href="https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7">Thick data is as important as bigdata.</a>.She explains how in 2009 when Apple introduced touch screen for the first time,led to the increased demand for Touchscreen phones.Thus leading to the epic fall of the once omnipotent mobile manufacturer Nokia as they largely focused on what thier databases implied rather than what the general public needed.
Scrolling through her&rsquo;s and other ethanography based blogs I realise how thier research papers and my personal expirences go hand in hand.</p>

<p>I believe, game changer technologies haven&rsquo;t always been revolutionising cutting edge technology. When Google introduced the Google Glass ,most of us considered it revolutionary, but however it failed the general public and infact didn&rsquo;t make it to the wider picture.On the contrary,an slight update from ubuntu in 2005 made it the second most used operating system back in the day. A new cutting edge technology maynot always widen the picture,but it sure leaves a mark for future innovators to work upon.</p>
